WHAT IT DOES:

HITMATIC can become as complex and valuable as you wish. At its simplest,
it can display the hitcount for a page to your visitors. At your option,
it can also be configured for complete website tracking and analysis.

Input to the script comes from special image tags that you place on each
web page that you want included in the system. When a browser loads
one of these pages it expects to receive a graphic from the URL in the
tag. Instead, the URL runs HITMATIC which counts and categorizes the hit,
does some maintenance stuff and finally creates the graphic (an X-Bitmap)
and outputs it to the browser.

Why X-Bitmap? Of the 3 standard image formats that web browsers can
display (.jpg, .gif and .xbm) this is the only one that uses an ASCII
file format and can be created by simple math. The overhead of having
to include a compiled jpg or gif generator is avoided, and HITMATIC
uses resources to calculate stats rather than displays pretty fonts.

To learn more about X-Bitmaps, read the comments in 'hitxbm.pl'.

'hit1.log' and 'hit2.log' save todays' and yesterday's hit data with
one line per hit (date, time, $pagecode, $command, user's IP address,
cookies and referring page). 'hitcfg.pl' runs daily file maintenance,
'hitxbm.pl' creates the XBM-BITMAP images of the hitcounts. 

Twelve files numbered hit1.dat - hit12.dat which each hold hit
counts by day and pagecode for one month.

The manager module (hitman.pl) gives you a choice of statistical tables
showing counts by month, by page, by group or full year.

The 'By YEAR' table starts 12 months ago and ends at the end of current
month. The grid shows the total hits by month for each group and each
page, ranked most to least popular. 'By MONTH' shows the hits for one
month on a daily basis. 'By PAGE' shows the hits for one page on a yearly
basis.

The HIT COUNTER shows the current hit count for each page since last
reset. You can reset the counter to any month in the pop-up box, and
HITMATIC will recalculate hits from data in the monthly hit files also
making a new 'since.xbm' image of the month and date which can be
displayed.

Daily file maintenance is run when the first visitor of the day causes
HITMATIC to run. Several things happen: 'hit1.log' is read and all hits
for the previous day are added to the monthly data files. If it's the
first day of a new month, last year's month file is emptied. 'hit1.log'
is renamed 'hit2.log', yesterday's 'hit2.log' is emptied and renamed
'hit1.log'. Finally, if a new hit count was requested since the last
maintenance, the 'hit.cnt' file is recalculated.

HITMATIC uses the Perl 'flock' function to prevent simultaneous
changes (corruption) of data files.

========================================================================

INSTALLATION:

1. SETUP YOUR FILES -

Open 'hit.cfg' in a text editor. The default file is '1|1|1|N|'. Change
the first '1' to current day-of-month (1-31), the second '1' to current
month (1-12). Leave the other fields as is and save the file. Hereafter,
these values will be read, changed and written by the script(s) so no
further editing should be required.

Add a reference to each HTML page to be counted, following this example:
<img
 src="http://yourserver.com/path/to/cgi-bin/hitmat.cgi?PAGECODE+GROUPCODE=COMMAND">

You will need to make these substitutions --

'PAGECODE' is a unique name (with NO SPACES) for the page being counted.
It can be real or symbolic (albert/home.html, links, page1, etc.).

'GROUPCODE' is optional but you can subdivide your hitcounts into
subject areas. Use a SINGLE letter or number for each group.

'COMMAND' tells the script which count to output on the page --
   'SITE' - display total hits to website,
  'GROUP' - display hits for a group,
   'PAGE' - display hits for a page, or
   'NONE' - display nothing, i.e. sends a null bitmap image.

Example of a full site hitcount displayed on my 'index.html' page:

<img src="./cgi-bin/hitmat.cgi?index+G=SITE" width=96 height=16
 align=top border=0> Pages Served Since <img src="./hit/since.xbm"
 width=64 height=16 border=0 align=top alt="Last Reset">

Note the PAGECODE is 'index', GROUPCODE is 'G' and COMMAND is 'SITE'.

As in the example, you can include an image tag for 'since.xbm'
to display the date (MMYY) when counter was last reset.

Adding width and height tags allows the page to load quicker --
 For 'SITE, 'GROUP' and 'PAGE' use 'width=96 height=16',
 For 'NONE' use 'width=0 height=0',
 For 'since.xbm' use 'width=64 height=16'.


2. CONFIGURE THE SCRIPT -

Open the main script file 'hitmat.cgi' in a text editor and change
the sample paths in the "CONFIGURE THE SCRIPT" section,
following the instructions found there.


3. UPLOAD FILES AND SET (CHMOD) PERMISSIONS -

All files should be uploaded in ASCII mode (yes even the .xbm's).

Place 'hitmat.cgi' (755), 'hitcfg.pl' (644), 'hitman.pl' (644)
and 'hitxbm.pl' (644) into your main cgi directory.

Create a directory named 'hitmat' (755) and place 'hit.cfg' (666),
'hit.cnt' (666), 'hit.flk' (666), 'hit1.log' (666), 'hit2.log' (666),
'hit.xbm' (666), 'hitmat.pwd' (666) plus the 12 files 'hit1.dat'
thru 'hit12.dat' (666) there.

If you enable the back-up option, create an empty directory named
'bak' (777) which can be shared with my other scripts that make
back-up files. This directory MUST be world-writeable!

========================================================================

HOW TO USE IT:

If set up correctly (!) just sit back and watch (?) as the script
and your visitors do all the work.

To RUN HITMATIC MANAGER, use 'manager' as a query-string.

Examples -
  http://www.GetCruising.com/cgibin/hitmat.cgi?manager

The response should be the password authorization form. The
initial password is 'password'. Of course you should change it soon
to something unique by entering a new password in the
'Change Password' box.

The default HIT TABLE is 'By YEAR' starting 12 months ago and ending at
the end of current month. To switch to detailed displays 'By MONTH',
'By GROUP' or 'By PAGE', select a radio button and press 'HIT TABLES'.
You can switch between displays in the same way.

Select 'HIT COUNTER' for a list of current hit count for each page
since last reset. To reset the counter to the beginning of a month,
select a starting month in the pop-up box, then press 'CHANGE'.
